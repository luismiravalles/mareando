<ul>
	<li>My Tyde aims to show the state of the tide in the most friendly way possible</li>
	<li>No internet connection needed</li>
	<li>You can add your favourite location. My Tyde will show the nearest data</li>
	<li>And the best: You can take photos of your place at any time and each photo will be
